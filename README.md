# Welcome!

I am an undergraduate researcher in statistics and economics at BYU. However, I post some of the projects and code I have worked on for fun here.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Projects
Here are some exploratory data analysis projects I have done through my coursework unrelated to classes in my program

## [2022 Midterms and the Impact of Independent Voters](https://samleebyu.github.io/Midterms2022/MultimodalProject.html)
In this project, I analyze how population density correlates with the party affiliation of the outcome of the 2022 Midterm Election results in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Additionally, I look at the closest races from the 2022 Midterms and how independent voters potentially could have impacted the outcome of the election.

## [A Stylometric Analysis of the Four Gospels](https://samleebyu.github.io/CloserToChrist/CloserToChrist.pdf)
In this analysis, I analyzed how the four gospel writers of the KJV Bible (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) can be uniquely identified based on the way they reference Jesus Christ. I created a random forest model to predict the authorship of a randomly selected verse.

## Other projects on here:

1. Income Limits:
- An advanced dynamic web scraper developed through Python using the Selenium module to scrape and collect data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development
- Pandas, BeautifulSoup, EDA, Threads, Data Cleaning

2. Traffic Citations:
- Another advanced dynamic web scraper developed through Python with Selenium to scrape data from the Seattle Municipal Court. Keeps track of and compiles changes in the data over time.
- Pandas, BeautifulSoup, EDA, Data Cleaning

3. Wage Growth:
- A dynamic web scraper developed using RSelenium.
- Scrapes base wages from BYU's student employment webpage and maps the nominal wage to the real wage using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics with more data scraping methods.
- R, data vizualization
