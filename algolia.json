In the realm of sports analytics and statistical modeling, the question of replicating tournament outcomes has become an increasingly intriguing challenge. Although there are various covariates that contribute to whether a team wins or lose, we aim to utilize the Field Goal Attempts (FGA) data from the 2022 regular season to replicate the 2023 results of the tournament.","tags":["R","Bayesian Statistics","MCMC"],"title":"Bayesian Modeling with NCAA Field Goal Attempts and Percentages","type":"post","url":"/2023/12/22/bayesian-modeling-ncaa-field-goals/","weight":0,"wordcount":3467},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"An exploratory data science project to research how changes in weather and air quality affect the incentives of both students and university parking police","date":1702684800,"description":"An exploratory data science project to research how changes in weather and air quality affect the incentives of both students and university parking police","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":"An exploratory data science project to research how changes in weather and air quality affect the incentives of both students and university parking police","excerpt_text":"An exploratory data science project to research how changes in weather and air quality affect the incentives of both students and university parking police","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":2500,"html":"An exploratory data science project to research how changes in weather and air quality affect the incentives of both students and university parking police","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702684800,"objectID":"2c982922f6e08133c294d61bb97a267f","permalink":"https://SamLeeBYU.github.io/2023/12/16/byu-traffic-citations-eda/","publishdate":"2023-12-16T00:00:00Z","readingtime":12,"relpermalink":"/2023/12/16/byu-traffic-citations-eda/","section":"post","summary":"This project is part of a two-post series.
